=== service-suite-provider === 
contains annotations used directly from api-runtime modules, i.e account-service-api-runtime etc. 

This is a public module intended to be depended upon when creating an service-api.

This module should not depend on ANY other module in the service-suite. (expcept possibly service-suite-core???)
