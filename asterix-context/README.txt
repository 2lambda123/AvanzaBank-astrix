=== asterix-context ===
This is the core for the runtime environment for asterix, both for consumption of asterix-beans as well as for providing asterix-services. 

Example: From the web-application we wan't to consume a set of services (TradingService, CustomerClient etc). 
Therefore we use this module create a "asterix-runtime" which allows us to bind to different services.
